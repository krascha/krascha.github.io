						This was a result of workshop, which was mainly about
						getting to know the world of patterns in the 3D way and working with them.
						It was a good opportunity to think freely, but in a
						practical way about these patterns and there possiblities in the modularity.
						After a short research time, it became clear, that the casual use of pattern's
						are too common, like furniture or decoration. The idea came up to make some kitchen tools.

						The next step was to determine, which standard tools to include
						and what kind of shape they need to have. I choose a icaheadron a combination
						out of the dodecahedron, that got twelve pentagons and twenty triangular.

							The everyday kitchen utensils, which are useful and which
							I took for my concept, were among other things a bowl, a noodle
							sieve and a storage box. In addition, it should be plugged into
							each other and take little space in the kitchen away.
