							This work is a collaboration with Graef.
							The goal was to develop a redesign for manual all-cutters.
							In my design, the combination of Frankfurt cuisine
							and an all-cutter was the focus. The focus was on the compactness,
							as well as the efficiency, so little walking path in the kitchen,
							as possible and much in one place create.

						By the standard dimensions of 40 x 60 x 85cm,
						it can be integrated into the kitchen line, as well as open.
						Through the glass pane on the side of the furniture,
						one can see and experience the function better.

					<p class="text_ani text gray">
						There are different additional functions: once a small refuse box,
						where the waste is simply pushed aside and later discarded,
						without constantly walking back and forth. The drawer itself,
						which offers storage space. The material to be cut would fall into
						a storage box, which can be resealed and thus keep the food fresh longer.
